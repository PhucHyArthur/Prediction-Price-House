# Decision Tree Regression with Housing Data

This project demonstrate the use of Decision Tree Regression to predict housing price.

## Overview

Decision Tree Regression is a machine learning technique commonly used for regression tasks. In this project, I apply it to predict housing prices based on various features available in the Housing dataset.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
If you don't have these libraries, you can install by using: `pip`

## Code structure
- Data is loaded from ./Housing.csv.
- Categorical columns are encoded using OrdinalEncoder.
- Numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler.
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- A Decision Tree Regression model is trained and evaluated.
